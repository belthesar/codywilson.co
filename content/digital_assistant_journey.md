I don't think I realized just how depressed that I've been thanks to the wombo combo of COVID-induced lockdown, starting a company, having that company fail, and combining that with the general state of, well, everything. I've lost so many of the tools and structures in my life that helped me be successful leading up to this point. But, I'm on a journey to trying to understand why I am the way I am, and also to reflect on the things that made me successful in the past. One of the things I miss is the healthy cycle of keeping a schedule up to date, having the various tasks and ideas and projects that I wanted to work on in the places that they need to be. I'll be sharing with you what I'm going to build to try and get back to that place.

## The problem
Ultimately, the biggest problem is that I am frustrated with myself to not be able 

I often find that I think of things to add to the list of things to do at the least opportune times. When I'm in the shower, when I'm getting ready for bed, when I'm driving. Thanks to voice dictation powered reminders, a feature that has been in iOS for years now, it's relatively easy to capture these things. What I don't have, however, is the rhythm or discipline to refer back to these reminders and ensure that I actually do something with them. This leads to one of two things - when I'm in the heat of the moment, capturing this reminder, I need to premediate when or where I am reminded of these todos, or they disappear into the deep dark woohoos of space, only to be discovered when I click on the reminders app and see the litany of forgotten things that I've been meaning to do. When I do pre-specifiy the time or place to be reminded, there's a significantly greater than zero chance that I will not be able to act on the reminder at that time. Plans could have changed, and reminding me to do something "when I get home" might be at 10:30 PM, when it is a poor time to be doing something that requires a lot of focus. Or, I'm coming home from work, I lack the energy to do the thing, and it then gets snoozed, no longer reminding me of it until the next day, when I'm in the same situation. 

There are times, however, when I do have gaps that I could execute on something that needs to be done. The weekend is rife with opportunity, but if I slip into "relaxation mode", I do not break out of that easily. My morning routine requires a shower before I look and feel human, so a prompt to reflect on my day and plan for that day right when I wake up will quickly get dismissed as "yet another thing I can't do right now", only to be forgotten.
